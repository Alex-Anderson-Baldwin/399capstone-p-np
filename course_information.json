This course looks at how to tackle these interdisciplinary problems through methods like probabilistic computer modelling, computer-based statistical inference, and computer simulations. The material is largely motivated by the life sciences but also uses examples from other sciences. It focuses on modelling and analysing real-world data with an emphasis on analysing DNA sequence data. No background in physical or life sciences is assumed.",

This means students wishing to use ESR laboratory facilities as part of the MSc programme will be subject to the same type of access requirements as ESR employees. This includes a security clearance (essentially a check of any convictions recorded against you) and a drug test prior to being given access to ESR resources. Students will normally be required to provide a DNA sample to ensure that any allegations of cross-contamination of a DNA sample can be properly investigated. The DNA profile will be retained by ESR.
