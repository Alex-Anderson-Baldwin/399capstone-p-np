This means students wishing to use ESR laboratory facilities as part of the MSc programme will be subject to the same type of access requirements as ESR employees. This includes a security clearance (essentially a check of any convictions recorded against you) and a drug test prior to being given access to ESR resources. Students will normally be required to provide a DNA sample to ensure that any allegations of cross-contamination of a DNA sample can be properly investigated. The DNA profile will be retained by ESR. All other information will be returned to the students at the completion of their studies. Students who would like further details of these conditions should contact the Programme Director.",
